		// WITH STRINGS AND VALUES, OUTPUTTING THE ACTIONS AND MORE
		let Year = 2022; //<- THIS IS HOW VARIABLES ARE DECLARE "LET" = WHATEVER
		//let NextYear = Year + 1;

		//let sentence = "tonight's dinner will be " + dinner;

		//function saySomething (param) { //FUNCTIONS = ACTION IN THIS CASE SAYSOMETHING
		//	console.log(param); 			// DECLARING WHAT THE ACTION WILL DO WHICH IS LINKED TO LINE 39 

		//}

		//saySomething (sentence);	//LINKED TO LINE 32 DECLARING VARIABLE SENTENCE TO BE "TONIGHT'S DINNER IS + DINNER"

		//function add (a,b) {
		//	return a+b;

		//}

		//let result = add (5,7);
		//console.log(result);


		//let multiply = (a,b) => {
		//	return a*b;
		//}

		//console.log(multiply(5,7));


		//ARRAYS AND LOOPS 
		// arrays are lists, they are named within [] and can be numerical or integers
		// example:
		let yearlist = [];
		let menu = [dinner, 'salad', 'steak','cheesecake', 'coke'];

		// loops are codes that run over and over again
		// for that to happen you have to set conditions called expression to control the loop
		// this expression is made up of 3 parts 
		// declare a variable to be the index = i
		// declare the duration of the loop = whiles i is less than 4 then keep going 
		// declare what happens to i in every iteration of the loop = increment by 1 so i++
		// example:

		for (let i = 0; i < menu.length; i ++) { 
		//if you change the 4 by menu.length it will run untill there are no more items in that array so if the array increases or decreases it won't affect the code's output
			console.log(menu[i]);

		}

		// can also use loops to add items into arrays
		// example:
		for (let i = 0; i<10; i++){
			yearlist.push(2022 +i);

		}
		console.log(yearlist);

		menu.forEach(item => {
			console.log(item);
			
		})






		//DRAW LOOP
		const width = 60;
		const gap = 25;
		const height = 60;
		let x,y;


		// can also use loops to draw
		for (let i= 0; i<5; i++) {
			// nested loop, for loop inside another for loop
			// examples
			for(let j = 0; j< 5; j++){

				x = 100+ (width +gap)* i;
				y = 100 + (height + gap) *j;

				context.beginPath();
				context.rect(x, y, width, height );
				context.stroke();

				//smaller squares inside some of the small quares (condition) if something do this else do something else (dont always need an else)

				//if (i > 0 && i < 4){

				//i moved the code that draws the smaller squares here, if not it won't run the code and continue to draw the squares within all the small squares

				if (Math.random()> 0.5){
					context.beginPath();
					context.rect(x + 8, y + 8, width - 16, height - 16);
					context.stroke();	
					//smaller squares inside all the small squares
					//RANDOM NUMBERS
					// Math.random - returns random number between 1 and 10, generative design
					// let's try it in the if condition loop to see what the computer will randomly generate 
				}
